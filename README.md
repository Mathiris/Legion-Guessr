# Legion-Guessr

##About the game "Guess the Legion of Honor"

This game was created to guess whether various personalities, from all walks of life and around the world, have been awarded the French Legion of Honor.
Above all, <b>it is a game designed for entertainment<b>, with no political or promotional intent.

The Legion of Honor is a prestigious distinction, but it does not define the value or importance of a person. Many influential historical figures have chosen to decline it for personal or political reasons. This game does not seek to glorify the award but rather to highlight inspiring individuals and their stories.

I would like to emphasize that I am the sole creator of this game and its dataset. The personalities included have been selected based on the information I have been able to gather. The dataset will continue to evolve over time as I discover new data and make updates.

Thank you for playing with curiosity and kindnessâ€”enjoy the game!
